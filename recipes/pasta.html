    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, 
        and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are 
        sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine. 
        Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, 
        although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines. 
        Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.</p>
