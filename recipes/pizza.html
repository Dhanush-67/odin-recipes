        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients<br> 
            (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.) which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
        <p>A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F)</li>
            <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) of active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 3/4 cups bread flour</li><br> One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Proof the yeast: Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Make and knead the pizza dough: Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</li>
            <li>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed: Knead on low to medium speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. If you don't have a mixer, you can mix and knead the dough by hand.</li>
            <li>Rise the dough: Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</li>
            <li>Preheat pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet): Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough and roll it out: Divide the dough into two equal size balls. Place each ball in its own bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).</li>
            <li>Prep toppings: Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way. About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza.</li>
            <li>Spread tomato sauce and sprinkle toppings: Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a floured work surface. Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza: Using a pizza peel, pick up the pizza and slide it onto the baking stone in the oven. If you don't have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or even a rimmed baking sheet turned upside down.</li>
            <li>Cook the pizza: Bake pizza one at a time until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10-15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and place it on a cutting board. Let the pizza cool for a minute or two so that the cheese has time to set slightly.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve: Use a pizza cutter or a sharp knife to cut the pizza into slices. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
